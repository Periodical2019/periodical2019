                <br> In today’s world, people have been using a large amount of plastic. In fact, plastic has been used in almost everything and in an uncontrollably rate. Plastic is becoming a threat to us, animals, and our oceans. This leads
                to researchers and scientists trying to find other materials to substitute plastic for our everyday usage.

                <br> One of the substitute materials that is being used now is stone wool. This material is from natural igneous rock and it’s formed after lava cools. Then, this material is being combined with a steelmaking byproduct that’s
                called a slag which becomes a fibre. The manufacture of stone wool is located in Europe, North America, and Asia. This material is being used in London and Hong Kong. One of the way that they use stone wool is by putting stone wool against
                the wall when they build a house or a building. Using this material will not only help us get a solution to our plastic problem, but it also gives us benefits. By using this material instead of plastic it can help boast unique properties,
                including fire resilience, acoustic and thermal capabilities, water repellency and durability in extreme weather conditions. Stone wool not only gives people those benefits, but it could also save their lives because stone wool gives extra
                measure of safety when wildfire and floods increase in its frequency and severity. That’s because stone wool is fire resistant and that can slow down a spread of fire which can give people more time to escape when there’s a fire. Not only
                it gives safety properties, but it also helps keep a house cooler because they have thermal properties from tiny pockets of air that keeps hot airs out. Also, stone wool contains 75 percent recycled content unlike plastic only gets 9 percent
                of it recycled. This is important because when something is recycled more instead of making more it helps create less harm to the environment such as carbon dioxide.

                <br> These are some of the materials that people could substitute plastic with and it’s really important to do so. This is connected to today’s world because right now people is still looking for materials to substitute plastic
                with and at the same time to be beneficial for us as human beings and our planet. Perhaps if we can cut down the usage of plastic by half, then it would help us, ocean, animals, and the earth in dramatic amount. SAVE THE WORLD!!!
