               Plastic pollution is a growing epidemic, as an estimated 385 million tons of plastic are produced every year. Plastic is very harmful to the marine environment because sea life attaches to the surface of plastic debris. Plastic production increases every year, leading many animals on land and in the ocean to be negatively affected. Although plastic pollution seems to be a never-ending problem, there are organizations to fight plastic pollution.

               The Alliance to End Plastic waste, also known as (AEPW), is an organization made to help fight plastic pollution in 2019. Presently, it is made up of almost 30 smaller organizations, which have accumulated over $1 billion dollars with the objective of contributing $1.5 billion throughout the following five years to help end plastic waste in nature. The organization will scale arrangements that will limit and oversee plastic waste and advance answers for utilized plastics by empowering a roundabout economy. Alliance participation speaks to worldwide organizations. The chairman of AEPW, David Taylor, urges companies around the world to join the organization because he believes international partnerships can end global problems.

            <div class="col-md-12 article">
                The AEPW has four major goals in mind: Infrastructure, Innovation, Education, and Cleanup.Infrastructure development is needed to acquire and manage waste as well as extend recycling programs. Innovation is to develop and scale newly applied sciences that make recycling plastics less complicated and create cost from all post-use plastics.Education is imperative for people to understand the negative impacts of plastic pollution so that they can be persuaded to make a change when using plastics.Lastly, Clean up will target areas of plastic waste that were in the environment, particularly the essential conduits of waste that raise the land-based plastic waste to the sea.

                The AEPW is a non-profit organization, that is partnered with the finance community, government and civil society, which includes environmental and economic development of NGOs (Non-profit organizations). The AEPW works alongside companies to tackle problems within the area as well as educate neighboring schools. Companies should join this organization since the AEPW aid small companies in resources they lack. People can help this organization reach its goal as they plan to have community involvement programs such as cleaning beaches and educating children about the harmful effects of plastic. The Alliance to End Plastic Waste requires industries and communities to work together to obtain their goals.
All in All, AEPW is needed to stop plastic pollution as this global threat shows no signs of stopping. The AEPW has built an organization where companies around the world can help stop plastic pollution.
