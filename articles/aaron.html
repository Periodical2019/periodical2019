        We live in an age of plastics. Our world is littered with plastic containers and products.  It is prevalent that our ecosystem is changing rapidly from the plastics we use. But, how did plastic become so widespread without being noticed? How did we become so consumed by a ecosystem destroyer? When did this all start?

        The age of plastic is the creation and invention of plastic containers and other objects. This time period evolved into what we know now as our modern era. Some argue that the earliest plastics introduced to the public, goes as far back as 1898 when polyethylene was the ubiquitous plastic. Others claim in 1933 polyethylene was created again. However, the turning point of plastics was during the 1960s. Prior to this decade, scientists have figured out how to create high-density polyethylene, specifically Erhard Holzkamp and Karl Ziegler of kaiser wilhelm institute.The high- density polyethylene is used to make basic items like plastic bags. This revolutionized the world.

              In 1960, consumerism was popular and a swedish company was interested in vending items without denting their wages. The companies name was Celloplast, and their idea was to package their items with plastic and make a bag that was dense enough to hold heavy items, however, able to fold as thin as paper. The plastic bag was created. Originally named the t-shirt plastic bag it eventually spread to other countries as a way to sell items cheap. With these events, the plastic age was in motion and eventually lead to the world we live in today. Today we use plastics for almost everything, from plastic bottles, to plastic containers. For 59 years plastic has dominated the manufacturing processes, being shipped to supermarkets, put in cars, and used for silverware. Due to its abundance, people are willing to discard of the plastic item more often. This is a problem because plastic isnâ€™t decomposable and when exposed to the world environment, it is lethal to most animals. Causing choking hazards for sea creatures, and mammals alike. This is the Age we live in today, the plastic age.
